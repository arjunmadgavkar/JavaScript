This file covers useful tools for JS development.

## rollup.js
Rollup is a tool that allows you to write modular code. JS did not allow this until recently and still isn't backwards compatible with browsers running older versions of Node. Therefore, rollup allows you to take advantage of the latest JS techniques and guarantees that it will across all browsers.

You can use rollup to create modules that can be exported so other projects can you use them (as we're doing in Griffin).
