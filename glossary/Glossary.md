## Declarative Programming: 
* Examples of languages that use the declarative paradigm are HTML, XML, and CSS. 
* You can write both declarative and imperative programs in some languages (i.e. JavaScript), so it's not entirely about the language, it's about the way the language is used.
* Real-life example of imperative vs. declarative programming: Imagine you want to get a coffee. You can go to a barista and tell him "first, put oat milk in the container then heat it up then ... and then hand it to me!" **or** you can tell him "give me a capuccino with oat milk." The second way, you just care about the result you want and let him figure out how to do it.
* Coding example of declarative programming: `<h1> Hello </h1>`. Why is this declarative? Because you aren't telling the browser how to do write "Hello" in a header tag. All you're saying is "I want this result" and then you allow the browser to handle the rest.
* Declarative programming makes use of underlying abstractions that are written imperatively. Luckily, we don't need to worry about them. 

## Imperative Programming:
* Many programming languages (i.e. Java) rely on the imperative paradigm. 
* In this paradigm, you explicitly tell the computer how to get to the result that you want. You describe the exact steps you're going to take to get a certain result.
* Real-life example of imperative vs. declarative programming: Imagine you want to get a coffee. You can go to a barista and tell him "first, put oat milk in the container then heat it up then ... and then hand it to me!" **or** you can tell him "give me a capuccino with oat milk." The second way, you just care about the result you want and let him figure out how to do it.
* Coding example of imperative programming: `for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) { res.push(i*2); }`. Why is this imperative? Because you are telling the computer exactly how to double every value in the array.
* Imperative programming explicitly tells the computer how to do something and, if saved as a function, can be used declaratively later.
